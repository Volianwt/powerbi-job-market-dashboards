## 📖 Project Overview
This repository showcases two Power BI dashboards that I independently built by following a real-world portfolio project from Luke Barousse. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with advanced Power BI development techniques, including ETL with Power Query, data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard interactivity.

Although inspired by Luke Barousse’s work, **every step was implemented manually inside Power BI Desktop**, including data transformation, modeling, visualization, and interaction setup — ensuring full technical understanding and reproducibility.
